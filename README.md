# E.M.Pilot

**AI Email Management Desktop App**

> An open-source on-device conversational AI email client desktop application that leverages your local PC's NPU

---

## Application Description

MailPilot AI is an AI email management application that integrates with Gmail accounts to automatically classify and summarize emails, generate AI-based auto-replies, and other features. It adds convenience to email usage by providing functions that email users have not been able to utilize before, offering these features through a conversational interface.

This desktop app was developed using React and Flask frameworks with Tauri, running AI models on Qualcomm Copilot+ PC NPUs to minimize dependency on existing cloud-based environments.

### Key Features Using AI Models

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Spam/Important/Sent/Self-sent/Filtered | Automatically classify and view emails by tabs |
| Email Summary View | Preview email content summaries in the list view |

| To-Do (Task Management) Display | Automatically organize and provide user's key schedules |
| Attachment Summary Function | Automatically summarize attached images and document content |
| AI Auto-Reply Generation | Generate automatic replies for received emails |
